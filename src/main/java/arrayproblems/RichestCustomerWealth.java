/*
You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the ithâ€‹customer has in the jth bank.
Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts.
The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
